# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- Check the live site -https://scribble-noteapp.netlify.app  (With login-Functionality)
- Check the live site - https://scribbleagain.netlify.app   (Without login-Functionality)

- A note-taking app featuring a text area for writing notes, a 'Copy' button for duplicating the content within the text area, and the ability to save the data locally on the device's storage via localStorage.
